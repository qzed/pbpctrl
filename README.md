# `pbpctrl`

Control Google Pixel Buds Pro from the Linux command line. Might or might not work on other Pixel Buds devices.

Allows reading of battery, hardware, software, and runtime information as well as reading and changing settings (ANC state, equalizer, ...). 


## Installation

### Arch Linux

A [`pbpctrl`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pbpctrl) package is provided via the AUR.
Alternatively, the [`pbpctrl-git`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pbpctrl-git) package can be used to directly build from the latest state on the `main` branch.

### Debian/Ubuntu

A [`pbpctrl`](https://mpr.makedeb.org/packages/pbpctrl) package is provided via the MPR.

### Installation via `cargo`

You will need to install the following dependencies:

- Ubuntu: `libdbus-1-dev pkg-config protobuf-compiler`
- Arch Linux: Please refer to the dependencies (`depends` and `makedepends` fields) in [this PKGBUILD](https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/PKGBUILD?h=pbpctrl).

To build install the binary via cargo, run
```sh
cargo install pbpctrl --git https://github.com/qzed/pbpctrl/
```
Use the `--tag` option if you want to install a specific tag instead of the latest `main` branch.


## Instructions

Pair and connect your Pixel Buds Pro before use.
Run `pbpctrl help` for more information.


## Notes on Battery Information

The Pixel Buds Pro support basic battery information via the AVCPR standard.
Support for this is still experimental in BlueZ and needs to be enabled manually by editing `/etc/bluetooth/main.conf` and setting
```
[General]
Experimental = true
```
or by starting BlueZ with the `--experimental` flag.
After this, battery status should be provided via UPower.

Note that this, however, will only provide a single battery meter for both buds combined, and none for the case.
For more detailed information, use `pbpctrl show battery`.
This also allows reading of the case battery as long as one bud is placed in the case (note that the case does not have a Bluetooth receiver itself).
